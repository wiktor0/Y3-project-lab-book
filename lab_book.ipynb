    "# General project information and intentions\n",
    "Solar cells have been a key area of development for many years now, but their effectiveness is greatly dependent on the location that they are placed in. They are primarily consisted of Silicon, a semicondutor with a band gap of around 1.1eV. A key limitation is this small band gap range, where if increased, the electrical output could be higher, even in locations where less solar radiation finds its way to the Earth's surface. This is why we are working towards designing Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs), a new and emerging technology which can utilise a larger range of band gaps than other convential SCs. \n",
    "\n",
    "# What Perovskites are, their potential, and how photovoltaic (PV) cells work\n",
    "A mineral consisting of Calcium, Titanium and Oxygen. This composite can be placed into a photovoltaic layer and influence the electrical properties of the whole solar cell in unique ways which will be investigated throughout this project. PVs are usually described as having a 'sandwich' of layers comprising them, with semiconductors driving the conversion of sunlight, with one electron heavy layer, and one primarily with holes due to doping. Holes are considered to be an 'absense of an electron', or alternatively a positively charged quasiparticle. When incident radiation passes through to these oppositely charged layers, electrical energy can be transferred to the anode and cathode layers due to recombination. This is essentially electrons and holes colliding. Since these are oppositely charged they repel, so once they collide their electrostatic repulsion gets converted to the previously mentioned electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of conventional PV cells consisting of Silicon, the positive and negative semiconducting layers must be made thick to raise the chances of liberating an electron. This leads to higher production costs since a substantial amount of material must be used in production. On the other hand, PSCs do not require an additional photon to liberate an electron into the anode-cathode layers of the solar cell, meaning they can be made thin, hence slicing the manufacturing costs. Pair this with a larger range of absorption spectra and a more tolerant crystalline strcture to defects, perovskites can generate much more bang for their buck over their lifetime. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Recombination rate and quantum efficiency\n",
    "- For this experiment since we are assuming ideal conditions to start with, we assume that all recombination is purely radiative. This means that ALL of the energy from the electron-hole collision is used to move them to the anode-cathode layers, further flowing to the electrical store. In real life this is not the case, and instead there is excess energy that produces photons and lowers the quantum efficiency (QE) of the system. This stems from numerous related factors such as raising the temperature of the cell, whereas ours is kept constant at 300K, meaning that quantum properties of electrons are kept the same throughout. QE is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons in the external circuit produced by an incident photon of a given wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Semiconductors, band gaps and background information\n",
    "- The band gap is the minimum energy needed to attain an excited state for an electron. Once in this state, an electron can propogate through the solar cell and contribute to the electrical output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semiconductors are a special type of material where the flow of current can be controlled and managed inside of electronic devices. In our case, this is SCs. The electrons in semiconductors are easily able to jump this energy gap and the electron concentration can be changed in each band by doping. This is the process of adding impurities, increasing conductivity massively plus creating unique optical and optical properties. Without this the solar industry would not exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that a narrow bandgap absorbs all light across a spectrum and produces high current BUT the voltage across the gap is small. On the otherhand, for a large band gap a high voltage is produced but can only absorb a small spectrum of light. This means that for a specific location a PSC with an optimal band gap can be deduced through experimentation and increase the electrical output, thus offsetting costs sooner by raising the electrical efficiency. We will be concerned with band gaps in the range 1.0-2.0eV. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity of radiation from the sun follows an inerse-sqaure law with distance in a vacuum, where obviously there is no air, hence air mass (AM) holds a value of AM0 before photons enter the atmosphere(The solar constant holds a value of 1367Wm<sup>-2</sup>). However, once they enter there are more factors at play since the photons now lose some energy with air and dust molecules now being in the medium. In this experiment AM values will range from 1.0-2.0 in intervals of 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average location based radiation is hence different depending on where you are, but is a combination of direct, diffuse and albedo radiation that finds its way to the surface. AM values depend on humidity and climate, where larger AM values can be interpreted as the light having to travel through more air molecules. When this is the case, the white light has MORE of its constituent colours absorbed and scattered by the atompshere than at thinner atmospheres. This leads to a varied spectral content arriving at the PSCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar irradiance as a function of wavelength hence will be plotted to later find a continuum of open circuit voltages. Further down the line, this voltage will be plotted against a range of band gap values to see where it peaks for each AM (voltage used as a metric to compare the location based data). Although it is too early to state exactly what will be done throughout at this early stage, the data of interest will likely be plotted on a heat map of the world to illustrate the findings for the later assessed stages of the project. Each subsequent entry will explain any updated motives to the progression of the project.\n",

These consist of queries or workloads that take more time and effort that the short term ones, and are marked once or twice per semester depending on progression.

A database was used to determine the maximum potential energy for silicon solar cells around the world (https://globalsolaratlas.info/map). This is why we will aim to compare the PSCs to conventional silicon based ones.\n",

The equation for $V_{oc}$ is given by:\n",

    "- $J_{G}$ is the generated current density, sometimes referred to as light generated current, involves two key processes.

First convert $E_{g}$ to $\\lambda$ then create step functions for each set of AM data to achieve the plots of $V_{oc}$ against $E_{G}$.

Unlike in week 3 where we used a value of 0.8, a value of 1 holds true the equations above being equal.

After we filtered each of these into an Excel spreadsheet, we checked through a wide range of them for graphs with EQE(%) -wavelength(nm) and imported the graphs into **webplot digitiser** to extract the data.

Finally, the maximum point of inflection on this curve indicates the maximum power point(MPP) of the cell, which is the product of where current and voltage are maximised. In our analysis it is therefore important to look for clues that link to a higher MPP, as it suggests (for a given AM) that we are close to a more optimal spectral match for the PV bandgap, $E_{g}$<sup>PV</sup>. This parameter has its importance highlighted in Alex's publication (DOI: 10.1038/s41578-023-00610-9) in the section: measuring the performance of wide band-gap photovoltaics. **$E_{g}$<sup>PV**</sup> can be calculated from the EQE directly for a more accurate result so from now on we will use this in our method because the reason why some papers using the same technology but get varying results may be because they use the optical bandgap instead.\n",

This is because we need to make the Watts into a flux, and at a particular wavelength, divide the irradiance by the energy, hence the additional factor of $\\lambda$ was needed to fix the issue.

    "# Week 10: Solving the discrepancy between simulated and reported values of J<sub>sc</sub> and V<sub>oc</sub>\n",
    "(4/11/23):\n",
    "The main aim this week was to fix the discrepancy in the code between these values. As Alex and her colleague delved deeper into the code, it was suggested by them that we broke down the j_g_func (Wk 10 - Fixing Functions/Technology 1 - MAPbI3/main.py) into seperate steps. However, this made no difference in the outputs. It was then suggested that instead of the integrate.simpson function that the integrate.trapezoid function was used because not all data points are evenly spaced out, meaning that Simpson loses some of its accuracy. This also did not alter the resulting values.\n",

    "After reading the paper that our supervisor and her colleague recommended for helping solve the issue (https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202100022), it became apparent that the j_g_func was corrected when it matched the form found with the added factor of $\\lambda$ found in the paper. It was next decided to alter the j_o_func function to match the form given in the same paper. This resulted in the V<sub>oc</sub> values being a much closer match (J<sub>sc</sub> was unaffected, since its function was not changed). The modified j_o_func function is found here: \n",

Tandem papers tend to be more rigorous, hence the reported results should accord more closely to any of our tandem simulated values. With the added analysis in the report on tandems, I will be able to apply my knowledge from solid state and semiconductor physics to, ideally, come up with a more accurate model for the perovskite performance based on its technology. By doing so, the method provided will aim to help a wide variety of researchers in the PV field.\n",

    "This week we aimed to add new data from an array of papers from the perovskite database and compare their reported band gaps with the values that we simulated. The path to the directory is given by: Wk 12 - More Technologies and Reported Band Gaps vs Simulated, where the important filtered values from each paper that we will use are. As we were unsure what was the best thing to investigate, I proposed that we start comparing reported values from the MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 technologies as we've already done those. For the tandems, I decided that we should investigate how the ratio of certain element affected results at the same band gap. These were the FAMAPbSnI3 compositions, and are found in this path: Wk 12 - More Technologies and Reported Band Gaps vs Simulated/Technology 3 - Tandems/Tandems_data.csv. With this data, an example plot comparing the reported values for MAPbI3 V<sub>oc</sub> is included below, and was repeated for MAPbI3.

This is because the band gaps determine what we reach, so we decided that the only comparison we will make between reported and simulated band gaps is in a table, where it will be easy to see how a range of results papers vary from our calculated band gap. It will be useful to use this comparison to examine the techniques that researchers use to calculate band gaps.\n",

A 1.2eV bandgap would mean a perovskite can absorb light with wavelegtnhs up to around 1030nm (1/1.2 *1240nm which is in the near IR range). For 1.8eV using the same method results in roughly 690nm which is in the visible range.

This therefore affects the built in voltage because less electrons or holes will change the fermi level of the SC, which directly leads to energy losses in the device, which translate into voltage losses through a changed band gap energy.\n",

The reason why only the single wide bandgap (WBG) EQE is taken from the top subcell is because the bottom subcell (at the low band gap) is receiving filtered light. This is very tough to factor into calculations, and literature has shown that EQE values for BOTH the top and bottom subcells are not provided. This means that if we took both, our reported values would be much greater than the literature suggests! \n",

The scatter in our simulated values is quite large, and sometimes, while not in this case the reported values may be above our simulated ones. This is not what is expected, where we always expect our simulated values to be the maximum possible J<sub>sc</sub> values that the solar cell in each paper can achieve.

Firstly, to try and solve the previous issues, we instead plotted the DB limit from one of our supervisor's colleagues' papers.

This could have worked the other way, but if the code was designed in such a way to balance out this unit change the other way.\n",

I had tried pointing this issue out a few weeks ago when the errors somewhat cancelled eachother out (as mentioned in week 14) and hence it was disregarded as an issue. But now it is clear that the EQE spectrum range really does matter! This is because, even though we have the same method and function for calculating the theoretical and simulated J<sub>sc</sub> points, their EQEs are different in each case. In other words, the EQE range can be used across the full spectrum of light that we have graphed previously, but it does our calculations no justice unless the important range is used throughout each calculation (indefinitely being the same every time). This ensures that the integration method has an equally spaced x array of values to maximise its accuracy.\n",

This provides a good overview and potential reasons as to why som erroneous values exist on our plots. As I previously questioned, it could have been to an incorrect active area approximation in the paper, which results in artificially large or low J<sub>sc</sub> values w.r.t our simulated values, which should always be higher or atleast equal to the reported ones."
