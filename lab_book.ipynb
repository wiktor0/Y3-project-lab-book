    "# General project information and intentions\n",
    "Solar cells have been a critical area of development for many years now, but their effectiveness is greatly dependent on the location in which they are placed. They primarily consist of Silicon, a semiconductor with a band gap of around 1.1eV. A fundamental limitation is this small band gap range, where, if increased, the electrical output could be higher, even in locations where less solar radiation finds its way to the Earth's surface. This is why we are working towards designing Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs), a new and emerging technology which can utilise a larger range of band gaps than other conventional SCs. \n",
    "\n",
    "# What Perovskites are, their potential, and how photovoltaic (PV) cells work\n",
    "Perovskite is a mineral that contains calcium, titanium, and oxygen. This composite can be placed into a photovoltaic layer and influence the electrical properties of the whole solar cell in unique ways, which will be investigated throughout this project. PVs are usually described as having a 'sandwich' of layers comprising them, with semiconductors driving the conversion of sunlight, one electron-heavy layer, and one primarily with holes due to doping. Holes are considered an 'absence of an electron' or a positively charged quasiparticle. When incident radiation passes through to these oppositely charged layers, electrical energy can be transferred to the anode and cathode layers due to recombination. This is essentially electrons and holes colliding. Since these are oppositely charged, they repel, so once they collide with each other, their electrostatic repulsion gets converted to the previously mentioned electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of conventional PV cells consisting of silicon, the positive and negative semiconducting layers must be made thicker to increase the chances of liberating an electron. This leads to higher production costs since a substantial amount of material must be used in production. On the other hand, PSCs do not require an additional photon to liberate an electron into the anode-cathode layers of the solar cell. This means that PSCs can be made thin, hence slicing the manufacturing costs. Pair this with a more extensive range of absorption spectra and a more tolerant crystalline structure to defects; perovskites can generate much more bang for their buck over their lifetime. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Recombination rate and quantum efficiency\n",
    "- For this experiment, since we are assuming ideal conditions, we assume that all recombination is purely radiative. This means that ALL of the energy from the electron-hole collision is used to move them to the anode-cathode layers, further flowing to the electrical store. In real life, this is not the case; instead, excess energy produces photons and lowers the system's quantum efficiency (QE). This stems from numerous related factors, such as raising the cell's temperature. In contrast, ours is kept constant at 300K, meaning that we assume the cells' electrons behaved the same way throughout. QE is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons in the external circuit produced by an incident photon of a given wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Semiconductors, band gaps and background information\n",
    "- The band gap is the minimum energy needed to attain an excited state for an electron. Once in this state, an electron can propagate through the solar cell and contribute to the electrical output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semiconductors are a particular type of material where the current flow can be controlled and managed inside electronic devices. In our case, this is SCs. The electrons in semiconductors easily jump this energy gap, and the electron concentration can be changed in each band by doping. Doping is the process of adding impurities, increasing conductivity massively, and creating unique optical properties. Without this, the solar industry would not exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "A narrow bandgap absorbs all light across a spectrum and produces a high current. However, the trade-off is that the voltage across the gap is small. On the other hand, for a large band gap, a high voltage is produced but can only absorb a small spectrum of light. This means that for a specific location, a PSC with an optimal band gap can be deduced through experimentation and increase the electrical output, thus offsetting costs sooner by raising the electrical efficiency. We will be concerned with band gaps in the range of 1.0-2.0eV. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity of radiation from the sun follows an inverse-square law with distance in a vacuum where there is no air. Hence, air mass (AM) holds a value of AM0 before photons enter the atmosphere(The solar constant has a value of 1367Wm<sup>-2</sup>). However, more factors are at play once they enter since the photons now lose some energy with air and dust molecules in the medium. In this experiment, AM values will range from 1.0-2.0 in intervals of 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average location-based radiation is different depending on where you are. Still, a combination of direct, diffuse, and albedo radiation finds its way to the surface. AM values depend on humidity and climate; larger AM values can be interpreted as the light travelling through more air molecules. When this is the case, the white light has had more of its constituent colours absorbed and scattered by the atmosphere than at thinner atmospheres. This leads to varied spectral content arriving at the PSCs depending on their geographical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AM=\\frac{1}{cos\\theta}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(where $\\theta$ is the zenith angle)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar irradiance as a wavelength function will be plotted to find a continuum of open circuit voltages. Further down the line, this voltage will be plotted against a range of band gap values to see where it peaks for each AM (voltage used as a metric to compare the location-based data). Although it is too early to state precisely what will be done throughout this early stage, the data of interest will likely be plotted on a world heat map to illustrate the findings for the later assessed stages of the project. Each subsequent entry will explain any updated motives for the project's progression.\n",

    "# Week 8: Pre-meeting thoughts \n",
    "\n",
    "(20/11/23):\n",
    "\n",
    "- I realised that many of the papers I previously excluded could be used because MAPbI3 is equivalent to CH3NH3PbI3. This also made me realise that to investigate the trade-off between $J_{sc}$ and $V_{oc}$, I should choose papers with widely varying $J_{sc}$. The following questions will be saved for the meeting later today:\n",
    "1. Is it ok to include data for different Jsc values on the same graph when comparing band gaps for the same technology?\n",
    "2. Is it useful to graph all AMs on the same plot or separate them since doing so would make our findings much easier to decipher from the expected theoretical values?\n",
    "3. How exactly do we find this trade-off? - is this the varying $V_{oc}$ values for the same band gap for the different integrated $J_{sc}$'s that the database gives us?\n",
    "**Some possible things that we could investigate further:**\n",
    "- How other atmospheric parameters affect SCs by using SMARTS\n",
    "- Investigate a wider range of technologies OR focus on more specific aspects of a technology \n",
    "- How location affects SC parameters by using SMARTS\n",
    "- Making comparisons between our data and Si SCs\n",
    "(22/11/23): Post meeting notes and plans to go forward \n",
    "- Form separate plots between calculated data and reported data- i.e. keep AM constant for each plot and then compare what the paper states their $V_{oc}$ is given by with what we obtained\n",
    "- Take the EQE data found from the papers with a pinch of salt as they may not have calibrated their SCs properly: researchers are required to measure EQE for a range of wavelengths so that system losses due to, for example, internal reflection losses are accounted for\n",
    "# **The physical significance of J-V characteristics**\n",
    "- Knowing how J-V relate to PV cells gives a comprehensive picture of electrical characteristics under various conditions (such as temperature and illumination), which is key to finding **accurate** overall cell performance. From the curve, $V_{oc}$ is the value when the current is zero, and similarly, $J_{sc}$ is when the voltage is zero. Finally, the maximum inflexion point on this curve indicates the cell's maximum power point(MPP), which is the product of where current and voltage are maximised. In our analysis, it is therefore important to look for clues that link to a higher MPP, as it suggests (for a given AM) that we are close to a more optimal spectral match for the PV band-gap, $E_{g}$<sup>PV</sup>. This parameter is important and is highlighted in [our supervisor's publication](10.1038/s41578-023-00610-9) in the section measuring the performance of wide band-gap photovoltaics. **$E_{g}$<sup>PV**</sup> can be calculated from the EQE directly for a more accurate result, so from now on, we will use this in our method because the reason why some papers use the same technology but get varying results may be because they use the optical band-gap instead.\n",
    "# **EQE spectra** \n",
    "- Indicates the efficiency of a SC in converting photons to electrons at different wavelengths of incident light.\n",
    "- High EQE at a given wavelength indicates effective absorption and charge carrier generation, which correlates to $E_{g}$<sup>PV</sup> and provides insight for optimal technologies\n",

    "(23/11/23): Separating simulated and reported values for each AM plot\n",
    "\n",
    "- This [publication](10.1002/aenm.201902573) explains important theory that forms the basis of accuracy needed for the project aims.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is Urbach energy the term for the slight gap in energy that Alex drew on the whiteboard?? The paper above explains it if so and could be important for the report**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The $J_{sc}$ values could be made much higher when using the method from [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202100022). This is with the additional factor of $\\frac{\\lambda}{hc}$ on the $J_{sc}$ equation presented in week 4. This enabled our previous results, which were 19 magnitudes too small, to be corrected to the correct magnitudes of the expected values from the research papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "(24/11/23):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The differentiation method was replaced with the method that calculates bandgap from the EQE spectrum. This more accurately fits the theoretical prediction and raises the $J_{sc}$ values into a range that is closed to the expected theory.

Our units for this were [Wm<sup>-2</sup>nm<sup>-1</sup>] but we needed it in photons [m<sup>-2</sup>nm<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>]. This is because we need to make the Watts into a flux and, at a particular wavelength, divide the irradiance by the energy. Hence, the additional factor of $\\lambda$ was needed to fix the issue. Although we mentioned the equation having an extra lambda factor the previous week, we just now realised the abovementioned process.\n",

The path to the directory is given by Wk 12 - More Technologies and Reported Band Gaps vs Simulated, where the important filtered values from each paper that we will use are. As we were unsure what best to investigate, I proposed that we start comparing reported values from the $MAPbI_{3}$ and $FAPbI_{3}$ technologies, as we've already done those. For the tandems, we should investigate how the ratio of certain elements affected results at the same band gap. These were the $FAMAPbSnI_{3}$ compositions and are found in this path: Wk 12 - More Technologies and Reported Band Gaps vs Simulated/Technology 3 - Tandems/Tandems_data.csv.

A 1.2eV bandgap would mean a perovskite can absorb light with wavelengths up to around 1030nm (1/1.2 *1240nm, which is in the near IR range). For 1.8eV, using the same method results in roughly 690nm, which is in the visible range.

    "(26/2/24):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Following today's meeting, it was established that there was something fundamentally wrong in our process. This was evident in the plots from last week, and based on this, we knew that either the detailed balance limit was incorrectly plotted OR there was a mistake in some of the previous theories we had used because our simulated values were ABOVE the DB line. Firstly, to try and solve the issues above, we plotted the DB limit from one of our supervisor's colleagues' papers instead. The pathway to find this data is shown here: [Click here](https://github.com/SprintingSand/Yr-3-Undergrad-Project/blob/7016e7d11386f6c5aa7d3422ff98e445a8632a4b/Wk%2015%20-%20Testing%20the%20Validity%20of%20Our%20Models/Technology%201%20-%20MAPbI3/DBLimit.xlsx) for the DBLimit file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now that we knew the DB line wasn't the issue, we set out to look through Tom's code bit by bit to see the root of the problem. Eventually, it was found that from week 4's code, there was a previously masked issue! A unit error in J<sub>g</sub> for our theoretical and simulated values was due to not passing an x array into the cumtrapz integration method, whereby our array wasn't evenly spaced. Also, the nanometer wavelength wasn't converted to metres. The error was masked by coincidence because the two errors almost cancelled out the order of 9 magnitude difference. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_evenly_spaced(arr) -> bool:\n",
    "    diff = np.diff(arr)\n",

Previously, our plots suggested that the simulated ones should be used instead. The fact that they are above the simulated suggests that our model is either wrong or the papers give quite artificially significant results.\n",

    "(29/2/24):\n",
    "\n",
    "- After a harrowing few days of going through minute details of our method, Tom finally found the apparent issue. This was to do with the J<sub>sc</sub> function, which is referenced here, firstly what it looked like and the most recent copy, respectively:\n",

    "[Previous version](https://github.com/SprintingSand/Yr-3-Undergrad-Project/blob/1a91f404a18f94b73b8bcfcde73ac8ae039fd640/Wk%2014%20-%20More%20Tandems%20and%20Alter%20Plots/Technology%201%20-%20MAPbI3/equations.py#L6)\n",

    "\n",
    "We noticed a couple of things. Firstly, 'wav' was in units of metres, but the spectrum that it was integrated over had 'nm' inside of its collective unit. This means that integrating w.r.t 'wav' would not give us the desired units. This is because the integrated 'wav' was not in the units of nm, and so could not have the nm<sup>-1</sup> unit cancelled in photon_to_amps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom corrected this from Am<sup>-2</sup>nm<sup>-1</sup> to Am<sup>-2</sup>m<sup>-1</sup> so that when integrating w.r.t 'wav' we would get the units \"Am<sup>-2</sup>\" out as required for the concurrent steps in the code. This could have worked the other way, but if the code was designed in such a way to balance out this unit, change the other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, this revealed another issue following the correction in units. A weird value came after integrating. This was because the 'wav' array was not evenly spaced. I pointed this issue out a few weeks ago when the errors somewhat cancelled each other out (as mentioned in week 14), and hence it was disregarded as an issue. But now it is clear that the EQE spectrum range does matter! This is because, even though we have the same method and function for calculating the theoretical and simulated J<sub>sc</sub> points, their EQEs differ in each case. In other words, the EQE range can be used across the full spectrum of light we have previously graphed. Still, it does our calculations only justice if the vital range is used throughout each calculation (indefinitely being the same every time). This ensures the integration method has an equally spaced x array of values to maximise accuracy.\n",

This provides a good overview and potential reasons for some erroneous values in our plots. As I previously questioned, it could have been to an incorrect active area approximation in the paper, which results in artificially large or low J<sub>sc</sub> values w.r.t our simulated values, which should always be higher or at least equal to the reported ones."

At first, we were going to focus on location based data from the Global Solar Atlas by NREL, to try and find the optimal bandgaps for the technologies at certain locations to see which bandgap produces the most outputted power. But without spectral response data, this was not possible. Because of this, we changed our aims. The aim was to make a computational framework that can assess reported device performance. This was done by measuring how close the reported values were to our simulated ones. In each case, the reported values should never exceed our simulated ones, since we assumed ideal conditions, and the reported literatures did not. Despite this, our model suffered some discrepancies, but not just limited to our simulated data points, but also to the reported values. This meant that over the course of our project we had to assess a lot of different research, and attend a conference to strengthen our ability to write a constructive reasoning behind the discrepancies. This had made the project challenging in that regard due to a lack of resources, but rewarding in the sense that our model works. \n",
