    "# Week 1: Find a range of Air Mass (AM) values as a function of the solar spectrum \n",
    "-  To start off, we had a prime aim of finding out how perovskite solar cells can achieve optimal output with varying geographical considerations. A database was used to determine the maximum potential energy for silicon solar cells around the world (https://globalsolaratlas.info/map), inferring why solar cells of different band gaps would be useful\n",
    "- Used this website as guidance to theoretical concepts for solar cells, semiconductors and sunlight (https://www.pveducation.org/)\n",
    "- Plotted solar spectrum for each airmass, using Global tilted irradiance (W/m^2/nm) on y-axis and wavelength (nm) on x-axis and used a useful paper to help do so (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2014.10.037)\n",
