    "- To start off we were given a brief introductionary file which included some sources. This included a database showcasing the maximum potential power for silicon solar cells in different locations. The key point was to understand that silicon has a bandgap of 1.1eV whereas perovskite solar cells have band gaps ranging from 1.2-2.0eV. This leads on to the fact that different locations "
