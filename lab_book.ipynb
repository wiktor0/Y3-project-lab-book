    "# General project information and intentions\n",
    "Solar cells have been a key area of development for many years now, but their effectiveness is greatly dependent on the location that they are placed in. They are primarily consisted of Silicon, a semicondutor with a band gap of around 1.1eV. A key limitation is this small band gap range, where if increased, the electrical output could be higher, even in locations where less solar radiation finds its way to the Earth's surface. This is why we are working towards designing Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs), a new and emerging technology which can utilise a larger range of band gaps than other convential SCs. \n",
    "\n",
    "# What Perovskites are, their potential, and how photovoltaic (PV) cells work\n",
    "A mineral consisting of Calcium, Titanium and Oxygen. This composite can be placed into a photovoltaic layer and influence the electrical properties of the whole solar cell in unique ways which will be investigated throughout this project. PVs are usually described as having a 'sandwich' of layers comprising them, with semiconductors driving the conversion of sunlight, with one electron heavy layer, and one primarily with holes due to doping. Holes are considered to be an 'absense of an electron', or alternatively a positively charged quasiparticle. When incident radiation passes through to these oppositely charged layers, electrical energy can be transferred to the anode and cathode layers due to recombination. This is essentially electrons and holes colliding. Since these are oppositely charged they repel, so once they collide their electrostatic repulsion gets converted to the previously mentioned electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of conventional PV cells consisting of Silicon, the positive and negative semiconducting layers must be made thick to raise the chances of liberating an electron. This leads to higher production costs since a substantial amount of material must be used in production. On the other hand, PSCs do not require an additional photon to liberate an electron into the anode-cathode layers of the solar cell, meaning they can be made thin, hence slicing the manufacturing costs. Pair this with a larger range of absorption spectra and a more tolerant crystalline strcture to defects, perovskites can generate much more bang for their buck over their lifetime. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Recombination rate and quantum efficiency\n",
    "- For this experiment since we are assuming ideal conditions to start with, we assume that all recombination is purely radiative. This means that ALL of the energy from the electron-hole collision is used to move them to the anode-cathode layers, further flowing to the electrical store. In real life this is not the case, and instead there is excess energy that produces photons and lowers the quantum efficiency (QE) of the system. This stems from numerous related factors such as raising the temperature of the cell, whereas ours is kept constant at 300K, meaning that quantum properties of electrons are kept the same throughout. QE is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons in the external circuit produced by an incident photon of a given wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Semiconductors, band gaps and background information\n",
    "- The band gap is the minimum energy needed to attain an excited state for an electron. Once in this state, an electron can propogate through the solar cell and contribute to the electrical output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semiconductors are a special type of material where the flow of current can be controlled and managed inside of electronic devices. In our case, this is SCs. The electrons in semiconductors are easily able to jump this energy gap and the electron concentration can be changed in each band by doping. This is the process of adding impurities, increasing conductivity massively plus creating unique optical and optical properties. Without this the solar industry would not exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that a narrow bandgap absorbs all light across a spectrum and produces high current BUT the voltage across the gap is small. On the otherhand, for a large band gap a high voltage is produced but can only absorb a small spectrum of light. This means that for a specific location a PSC with an optimal band gap can be deduced through experimentation and increase the electrical output, thus offsetting costs sooner by raising the electrical efficiency. We will be concerned with band gaps in the range 1.0-2.0eV. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity of radiation from the sun follows an inerse-sqaure law with distance in a vacuum, where obviously there is no air, hence air mass (AM) holds a value of AM0 before photons enter the atmosphere(The solar constant holds a value of 1367Wm<sup>-2</sup>). However, once they enter there are more factors at play since the photons now lose some energy with air and dust molecules now being in the medium. In this experiment AM values will range from 1.0-2.0 in intervals of 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average location based radiation is hence different depending on where you are, but is a combination of direct, diffuse and albedo radiation that finds its way to the surface. AM values depend on humidity and climate, where larger AM values can be interpreted as the light having to travel through more air molecules. When this is the case, the white light has MORE of its constituent colours absorbed and scattered by the atompshere than at thinner atmospheres. This leads to a varied spectral content arriving at the PSCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar irradiance as a function of wavelength hence will be plotted to later find a continuum of open circuit voltages. Further down the line, this voltage will be plotted against a range of band gap values to see where it peaks for each AM (voltage used as a metric to compare the location based data). Although it is too early to state exactly what will be done throughout at this early stage, the data of interest will likely be plotted on a heat map of the world to illustrate the findings for the later assessed stages of the project. Each subsequent entry will explain any updated motives to the progression of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preliminary experimental expectations\n",
    "- As AM increases, the solar irradiance peak shifts towards longer wavelengths due to Rayleigh scattering.\n",

    "# Project planning (Short, medium and long term)\n",
    "- Short: these plans of action will primarily consist of the outcomes of the (nearly) weekly meetings with Alex. Anything from a day to a week falls under this category and usually is a query resolvable in this timeframe, enabling progression to the next goal.\n",
    "- Medium: More than a week but less that a semester long. These consist of queries or workloads that take more time and effort that the short term ones, and are marked once or twice per semester depending on progression. The first one is ideally where we'd like to be before the christmas break, so that we have time to focus on exams etc. \n",
    "- Long: The ideal outcome of the year long project that will be indicated a few weeks into the first semester once a clear picture/idea can be painted for where we want to arrive with it in the end. This may be updated in the second semester if plans change, and even have goals added to the initial ideas if progression is fast enough. "

    "# Week 1 (05/10/23): Find a range of Air Mass (AM) values as a function of the solar spectrum \n",
    "- To start off, the prime aim is finding out how perovskite solar cells can achieve optimal output with varying geographical considerations. A database was used to determine the maximum potential energy for silicon solar cells around the world (https://globalsolaratlas.info/map). This is why we will aim to compare the PSCs to conventional silicon based ones.\n",
    "- Used this website as guidance to theoretical concepts for solar cells, semiconductors and sunlight (https://www.pveducation.org/). It helps to understand the theory of how SCs behave differently if their band gaps are higher.\n",
    "- Found a software called SMARTS which enabled to get data for various AM values. This is a useful software that was designed to analyse radiative transfer of sunshine through planetary atomspheres, ultimately predicting surface solar irradiance and can obtain many more parameters too.\n",
    "- Plotted solar spectrum against wavelength for AM1.0- AM2.0 in 0.25 increments, using Global tilted irradiance (Wm<sup>-2</sup>nm<sup>-1</sup>) on y-axis and wavelength (nm) on x-axis and used a useful paper to help do so (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2014.10.037). This step was importance because it allows us to graphically illustrate the influence that humidity and temperatures have on a photon's path to the Earth's surface.\n",

    "- Started off the week by adding each of the txt files gained from SMARTS for the range of AM values into the repository to be able to use $V_{oc}$ as a metric to show its influence on bandgaps.\n",
    "- Created functions to find the minimum value of a diode's saturation current density($J_{o}$) and one to find $V_{oc}$. These both inputted parameters and variables that needed to be researched with papers due to no previous knowledge. $V_{oc}$ is defined as the maximum voltage available from a solar cell, occuring at zero current. The equation for $V_{oc}$ is given by:\n",
    "$$V_{oc} = (kT / q)log(J_G / J_o + 1)$$ (1)\n",
    "- $J_{G}$ is the generated current density, sometimes referred to as light generated current, involves two key processes. The first being the absorption of incident photons creating electron-hole pairs (explained previously). The second is the seperation of these charge carriers between the p-n junction such that if the emitter and base of the SC are connected (i.e the SC is short circuited), the light-generated electrons flow through the external layer to be captured in a store. Each of these current densities have units of Am<sup>-2.\n",

Next week I will be aiming to use the theory of EQE in SCs in order to find the ratio of J<sub>G</sub> and J<sub>o</sub> to find a set of V_{oc}$ values as shown by (1).\n",

This means that the solar cell data will be for the ideal operation conditions at the specific AM and band gap where fluctuations from factors such as temperature are not constantly affecting SC output.\n",
    "- Looked into papers on MXenes and how they are able to increase the electrical output in PSCs by reducing the recombination rate but unfortunately these papers didn't help towards the road block previously explained. (Papers of interest have either been logged in a shared mendeley repository, google drive or in github)\n",
    "- Still unsure where to go with the code to obtain the plots for the rest of the AMs; need a better value for external quantum efficiency (EQE) currently using 0.8 and need a better idea on spectral response. I think that it would greatly change throughout band gaps thus its not possible to progress until this matter is resolved.\n"

    "- We're starting with the assumption that conditions are optimal for the PSCs and working from there\n",

(The recombination rate is when a light-generated electron recombines with a hole to produce a photon. A low value hence raises efficiency) Below is an equation for the saturated current $J_{o}$. The blackbody (BB) spectra is taken at room temperature (300K) hence kept constant for reasons previously stated.\n",

Our assumption assumes that energies are greater than $E_{g}$ (all is absorbed and hence only radiative recombination occurs as mentioned above) and if they are smaller than $E_{g}$ they pass through. (What if I could make a more accurate assumption for my report?). First convert $E_{g}$ to $\\lambda$ then create step functions for each set of AM data to achieve the plots of $V_{oc}$ against $E_{G}$. Since this is a step function, all energies above the band gap are absorbed and converted into electricity when EQE=1. Unlike in week 3 where we used a value of 0.8, a value of 1 holds true the equations above being equal. This step is a big assumption and in the report I will be talking about how deviating from ideal values would impact outcomes. Below shows this step function for bandgaps:\n",

Later could compare to a Si based cell. Justify the limits chosen for the EQE such as $\\lambda$, since PSCs can not capture wavelengths past a certain limit.\n",

This infers that our method is correct so far, however the project outcomes may have to be changed because for 1.2-2eV there was hardly any difference for $V_{oc}$ at all of the AMs. As expected, at very high band gaps there is a swift drop in $V_{oc}$, and for a higher AM it drops off first w.r.t lower AMs. This checks out with the theory because as $V_{oc}$ increases with $E_{g}$, the recombination current falls to zero. \n",
    "- Alex expected this difference to be much more apparent across the 1.2-2.0eV range since the band gap for perovskites is 1.55eV, however it seems not (at ideal conditions anyway). The confusing part is that the method used applies to all solar cells, not just PSCs, so could there be clues as to why there are hardly any fluctuations between the AMs in the original imported SMARTS data?\n",
